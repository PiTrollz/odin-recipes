This project will contain some recipes that i made to improve my hyper caloric diet.

I will use this project to improve my knowledge when making a website with only html. I will use everything that I've learned so far. 

Here is a list of the things that i aim to do:
1. Use specific headers;
2. Use <strong> and <em> tags;
3. Create links (relative) and put images (absolute);
4. Put some comments in the code;
5. Create an unordered list and an ordered list.
